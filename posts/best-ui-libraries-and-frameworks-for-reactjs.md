Since React has been introduced dozens of UI libraries and frameworks started to come out one by one and it's continuing. All of these tools, boilerplates and UI components are here to save your time and help you focus on building apps. 

With these tools, you no longer need to worry about designing elements and components and trying to keep them consistent at the same time, which is a **time-consuming** process, even if you have a designing background.

In this list, I try to share the best **UI libraries and frameworks** based on my personal experience and **opinion**.

## Material UI

[![Material UI](/static/img/posts/best-ui-libraries-and-frameworks-for-reactjs/react-ui-libraries-1.png)](https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/)

There are several material design UI frameworks for React, but this is my **favorite** one because of the implementation of components which looks better than similar frameworks.

Version 1 is still in *beta* and has much more stuff but it's inconsistent and API changes a lot. However, I still recommend you to try the **latest version**, as we did in The Devs. 

- **Well implemented** Material design
- Suitable for **every** website
- [**create-react-app**](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [**Next.js**](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) examples
- v1 beta is a lot better, but **API changes** a lot
- [**JSS**](https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss) makes it a little **harder** and time-consuming to start with
- **Customizable** theme with JSS

## Blueprint

[![Blueprint](/static/img/posts/best-ui-libraries-and-frameworks-for-reactjs/react-ui-libraries-2.png)](http://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint has a clean design similar to bootstrap, but **better**. It has its own **design system** which helps you to use components in their correct form and place.

- **Lots of components** with great designs
- Has APIs for **both CSS and JS**
- Built with **Typescript**, examples are also in Typescript
- **Flexible** and customizable styles built with **Sass**
- Extensive **Documentation**

## Ant Design

- Almost every **Bootstrap 3** components available for React
